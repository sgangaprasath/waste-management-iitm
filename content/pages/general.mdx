      # General guidelines for waste disposal


      The following waste disposal guidelines have been implemented across our
      campus and shall be strictly adhered to across the campus. All students,
      faculty, staff and campus visitors are required to stick to these
      practices.


      ## Waste Segregation


      * Use the three-bin system for waste disposal:
        * Green bin for organic/biodegradable waste
        * Blue bin for dry/recyclable waste
        * Red bin for non-recyclable waste
      * Utilise the clearly marked recycling bins placed across campus for
      specific waste types (paper, plastic, glass, etc.)


      ### E-Waste and Hazardous Materials


      * Dispose of e-waste (electronic devices, batteries) only in the
      designated e-waste collection points. E-waste is collected separately by
      the Xpert team or there is an in-person drop-off in the campus shopping
      center.

      * Specific guidelines need to be followed for handling and disposing of
      hazardous waste, especially in laboratories.
        \
        Refer to the [Lab Waste page](/lab) for more details about hazardous material disposal guidelines.

      ### Waste Reduction


      * Bring and use reusable containers, water bottles, and utensils to
      minimize single-use plastics.

      * Dispose organic waste from cafeterias and gardens in designated
      composting bins.
