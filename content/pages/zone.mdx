      # Zone-specific guidelines


      IIT Madras campus is divided in 3 zones: a) Academic zone, b) Hostel zone
      and c) Residential zone. These different zones generate different kinds of
      waste.


      The academic zone has a great number of floating population besides the
      students, faculty and the staff. Whereas the hostel zone is primarily
      occupied by the students. And the residential zone has the faculty, staff
      and their family members.


      We have designed segregation and disposal policies taking into account the
      needs of the residents of these different zones.
