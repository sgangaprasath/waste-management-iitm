      ## General guidelines for waste disposal on campus


      As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, the following
      waste disposal guidelines have been implemented across our campus. All
      students, faculty, staff and campus visitors are required to adhere to
      these practices.


      ## Waste Segregation


      * Use the three-bin system for waste disposal:
        * Green bin for organic/biodegradable waste
        * Blue bin for dry/recyclable waste
        * Red bin for hazardous waste
      * Utilize the clearly marked recycling bins placed across campus for
      specific waste types (paper, plastic, glass, etc.)


      ### Waste Reduction


      * Bring and use reusable containers, water bottles, and utensils to
      minimize single-use plastics.

      * Dispose organic waste from cafeterias and gardens in designated
      composting bins.


      ### E-Waste and Hazardous Materials


      * Dispose of e-waste (electronic devices, batteries) only in the
      designated e-waste collection points.

      * Follow the specific guidelines provided for handling and disposing of
      hazardous waste, especially in laboratories.
